<h2>Local KHRD Help: About event type 2 (Born)</h2>

<p>In the KHRD, every person loaded from legacy data has had a Born event created for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>date has been entered where it was deemed a valid date (you can view these grouped/counted by year from the Event manager);</li>
<li>the event is undated if there were multiple conflicting birth dates; these Born events have had a <b>resolveMultipleBirthDates</b> task noted on the event (you can access a list of these from the Event manager);</li>
<li>the event is undated if there was no birthDate in the legacy sources; these Born events have had a <b>findBirthDate</b> task noted on the event (you can access a list of these from the Event manager);</li>
</ul>

<p>These <b>autoloaded births are identified by 200000 + the person_id number</b>. User entered birth events will be numbered much below that.<p>
