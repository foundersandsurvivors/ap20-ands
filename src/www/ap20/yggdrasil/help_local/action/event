<h2>Local KHRD Help: Events</h2>

<p>A yggdrasil "event" describes a kind of dated, placed thing that has happened to a person.</p>
<p>An event may be associated with a source text, which provides a "citation" or evidence for the event.</p>

<p>There is no provision as yet for structured/validated data capture about events other than a date and place.</p>
