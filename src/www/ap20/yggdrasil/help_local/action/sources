<h2>Local KHRD Help: Sources</h2>

<p>One of Yggdrasil's core and best features is its good support for recording evidence -- i.e. a "source" -- independantly from any assertions about events or persons' existance and relationships derived from a source. Sources are organised as a hierarchical tree of sources, where "branch" type sources can contain other sources (subsources) and "leaf" sources contain transcripts and/or descriptions of sources.</p>

<p>A yggdrasil "source type" is an attribute of an Yggdrasil source, which defines the TYPE of source.</p>

<p>A source type may be a Leaf or a Branch.</p>

<h3>Branch sources</h3>
<p>These only contain other Branch sources, and/or Leaf sources. Branch types include: "Page", "Chapter", "Section", "Volume", "Book",  "Jurisdiction", "Main Category", "Series", "Year", "File", "Family".</p>

<h3>Leaf sources</h3>
<p>These contain texts which can be transcripts of sources. They cannot contain other sources. Their parent source's type must be of source type Branch. Leaf types include: "Birth record", "Marriage record", "Death record", "Enumeration", "Transcript".</p>

<h3>Possible organisation of the source "tree"</h3>

<p>This depends very much on existing eveidence and the researchers' and project's requirements.</p>

<p>KHRD Example:</p>
<pre>
   Label of a source:                Source type 
   ==================                ===========
   Birth Evidence                    ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       NSW                           ( branch type="Jurisdiction [#16]")
           1850                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
                006289                                           ( leaf   type="Death record" )
           1851                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
           etc. for each year
       VIC                           ( branch type="Jurisdiction [#16]")
       etc. for each jurisdiction

   Marriage evidence                 ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       Jurisdiction / Year / leaf as shown above for Birth evidence.

   Death evidence                    ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       Jurisdiction / Year / leaf as shown above for Birth evidence.

   BPA Reports                       ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       State/Station/Placename       ( branch type="Jurisdiction  [#16]")
           1851                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
                Station return                                    ( leaf   type="Transcript" )
   
</pre>

<h3>Requirements under consideration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enable upload and/or linkage to images of sources.</li>
<li>Enable export/import of sources and source types from XML.</li>
<li>In addition to plain text editing, support XML or JSON encoding for recording structured data from source text and assisted editing.</li>
<li>Linkable web service to "mine" source text for structured data.</li>
<li>Structured XML editing using MediaFlux (experimental) which would provided a customised web forms interface.</li>
<li>Enable a source to a be a typed cross-reference to an external service e.g. FAS pubsearch for a convict, Trove.</li>
</ul>
