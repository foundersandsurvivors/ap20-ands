<h2>Local KHRD Help: Source types</h2>

<p>A yggdrasil "source type" is an attribute of an Yggdrasil source, which defines the TYPE of source.</p>

<p>A source type may be a Leaf or a Branch.</p>

<h3>Branch sources</h3>
<p>These only contain other Branch sources, and/or Leaf sources. Branch types include: "Page", "Chapter", "Section", "Volume", "Book",  "Jurisdiction", "Main Category", "Series", "Year", "File", "Family".</p>

<h3>Leaf sources</h3>
<p>These contain texts which can be transcripts of sources. They cannot contain other sources. Their parent source's type must be of source type Branch. Leaf types include: "Birth record", "Marriage record", "Death record", "Enumeration", "Transcript".</p>

<h3>Possible organisation of the source "tree"</h3>

<p>This depends very much on existing eveidence and the researchers' and project's requirements.</p>

<p>KHRD Example:</p>
<pre>
   Label of a source:                Source type 
   ==================                ===========
   Birth Evidence                    ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       NSW                           ( branch type="Jurisdiction [#16]")
           1850                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
                006289                                           ( leaf   type="Death record" )
           1851                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
           etc. for each year
       VIC                           ( branch type="Jurisdiction [#16]")
       etc. for each jurisdiction

   Marriage evidence                 ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       Jurisdiction / Year / leaf as shown above for Birth evidence.

   Death evidence                    ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       Jurisdiction / Year / leaf as shown above for Birth evidence.

   BPA Reports                       ( branch type="Main category [#17]")
       State/Station/Placename       ( branch type="Jurisdiction  [#16]")
           1851                      ( branch type="Year [#19]")
                Station return                                    ( leaf   type="Transcript" )
   
</pre>

<h3>Requirements under consideration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add types for supported external cross-references:
   <ul>
   <li>100: FAS Ship xref : (Branch) External cross reference to FAS convict ship ( generates a "leaf" for each convict transported on that ship)</li>
   <li>110: FAS Convict xref : (Leaf) External cross reference to FAS convict search</li>
   <li>180: NAA WWI service record : (Leaf) External cross reference to NAA WWI service record</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Have branch sources (and source types) loaded and defined from XML.</li>
</ul>
