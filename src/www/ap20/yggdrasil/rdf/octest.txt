MAINTENANCE. - Amelia Woodhall summoned John Woodhall, her husband, for leaving her without means of support.
Defendant said he had a house and five acres of land, and was willing to receive his wife and children.
Mr. Lees, for the complainant, said defendant went away eleven months ago with a young woman and had since brought her to live in the immediate neighborhood ; he lived a life of idleness, and lived on the labor of his wife.
Defendant referred to the profits of his trade, and the stock of trees he had on his ground.
The Bench under the circumstances said they could not make any order.
Complainant then claimed the protection of the court against defendant's violence, and The Police Magistrate said that was a matter for another proceeding ; she had her remedy if she had any ground to fear his violence.
Complainant protested that she would not live with her husband again.
The Bench told her she might obtain protection for her earnings by resorting to the proper tribunal.
Mr. Lees intimated that this course would be adopted.

Assault.-Catherine Whittaker charged John Woodhall with assaulting her on 29th December last.
The complainant deposed that the defendant assaulted her near the door of her father's house.
Defendant at first commenced kicking up a row with witness's father. He then called witness names and struck her with his fist under the ear and knocked her down. Witness then threw a stone at him which hit him.
Cross-examined: Did not strike defendant first.
Richard Whittaker corroborated the complainant's evidence.
A little boy named Michael Whittaker was called but the Bench did not think it fit to receive his evidence.
The defendant called Thomas Coates who said that Whittaker and defendant had some words about a fence and then
the complainant hit defendant who then hit her and then she threw stones. The dispute began about a fence which Woodhall said was on his ground and he went to pull it down.
John Crowther was next called but knew nothing of the alleged assault.
The Bench dismissed the information, but cautioned defendant not to go on Whittakers premises again.
